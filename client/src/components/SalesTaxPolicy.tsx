        At <strong>princetongreen LLC</strong>, we offer professional consulting
        and coaching services through our Florida-based platform. Here’s how we
        handle sales tax, so everything’s transparent and easy to understand.
      </p>

      <h3>🌴 Based in Florida</h3>
      <p>
        We’re registered in the state of Florida, where{" "}
        <strong>most services are not subject to sales tax</strong>. So, if
        you’re purchasing from Florida, no sales tax will be added to your
        invoice.
      </p>

      <h3>🌎 Customers in Other States</h3>
      <p>
        Sales tax laws vary from state to state — and what matters is{" "}
        <strong>where you’re located</strong>, not where we are.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Some states may require us to collect sales tax if the{" "}
          <em>type of service</em> you’re purchasing is taxable there.
        </li>
        <li>
          If we meet certain thresholds in your state (like sales volume or
          number of transactions), we may be <strong>legally required</strong>{" "}
          to collect tax.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If that applies, any applicable sales tax will be{" "}
        <strong>automatically calculated at checkout</strong> and clearly
        displayed before you complete your purchase.
      </p>

      <h3>💡 A Note on Responsibility</h3>
      <p>
        If no tax is collected during checkout and your state requires it, you
        may be responsible for reporting and paying a <strong>use tax</strong>{" "}
        directly to your local tax authority.
      </p>

      <h3>🌐 International Customers</h3>
      <p>
        We welcome clients from all over the world. If you're located outside
        the U.S., no U.S. sales tax will be applied. However,{" "}
        <strong>your country may have its own tax requirements</strong>. Please
        check with your local authority if you're unsure.
      </p>
